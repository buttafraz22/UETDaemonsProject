This is the code for the daemon I built in Linux Machine on a Ubuntu operating system. This project
was done as part of my final presentation for Operating Systems in Spring 2023 semester at UET Lahore.

1) This will only run in a linux machine.
2) Be sure to replace the occurences of working directory with your own (A comment to this effect is also penned in the code.)
